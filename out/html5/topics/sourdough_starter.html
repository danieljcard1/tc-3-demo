        <p class="p">A sourdough starter is a fundamental element in the art of making sourdough bread. It is
            a mixture of flour and water that serves as the living culture of wild yeast and lactic
            acid bacteria essential for leavening the dough and imparting the characteristic sour
            flavor.</p>
        <p class="p">Creating a sourdough starter involves a simple process of mixing flour and water and
            allowing it to ferment over several days. The natural microorganisms in the environment,
            such as those on the flour's surface, colonize this mixture, making it a potent
            leavening agent.</p>
        <p class="p">Regular feeding and maintenance are crucial for a healthy sourdough starter. This
            involves periodically discarding a portion of the starter and refreshing it with fresh
            flour and water to keep the microbial community robust and active.</p>
